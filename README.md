Developed and deployed a scalable, multi-tier face recognition application on AWS using EC2, S3, SQS, and Python. 

Designed and implemented a custom auto-scaling controller (without AWS Auto Scaling) to dynamically launch or stop up to 15 App-Tier EC2 instances based on real-time SQS queue length. 

Utilized a PyTorch-based deep learning model for face classification, integrated with Flask-based Web Tier handling HTTP requests.

 Ensured efficient inter-tier communication via S3 buckets and SQS queues, while maintaining instance orchestration, fault tolerance, and performance under concurrent workloads. 

Deployed the system within Free Tier limits, supporting over 100 simultaneous HTTP requests with dynamic elasticity.
